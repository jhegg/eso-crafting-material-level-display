eso-crafting-material-level-display
===================================

An Elder Scrolls Online addon that displays the level of crafting materials in the item tooltips (as viewed from your bag or bank).

At this time, it is only setup to display the crafting skill levels for provisioning ingredients. It does so based on string comparisons of the lower-case item name, matched against data retrieved from http://tamrieljournal.com/eso-provisioning-ingredients/ . Note that this unfortunately means that currently it only works for English game clients.

This addon is not intended to replace things that provide recipe information, such as [Sous Chef](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info163-SousChef.html), which I personally use and find to be very valuable when working on Provisioning. Instead, the primary use case for this addon is to identify those materials in your bag and bank that are below your skill level, which you might want to either get rid of or put onto a bank alt.

In the screenshot below, the text "Skill Level 30" was added by this addon.
