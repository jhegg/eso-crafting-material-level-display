eso-crafting-material-level-display
===================================

An Elder Scrolls Online addon that displays the level of crafting materials in the item tooltips (as viewed from your bag or bank).

At this time, it is only setup to display the crafting skill levels for provisioning ingredients. It does so based on string comparisons of the lower-case item name, matched against data retrieved from http://tamrieljournal.com/eso-provisioning-ingredients/ .

In the screenshot below, the text "Skill Level 30" was added by this addon.
